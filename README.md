# ESPnRF24 Jammer
A low-power 2,4GHz wireless jammer based on `ESP32` and `nRF24LO1+PA+LNA`

## Features

- A web interface for control and settings
- Multiple jamming modes:
  - WiFi (2.4 GHz)
  - Bluetooth, BLE
  - Zigbee
  - Drones
  - Custom frequency ranges
- Configurable `TX` power in the interface
- `SSD1306` OLED display support for basic status
- Various configuration options
- And more

## Hardware Requirements

For this project, i have used my cheap `esp32s3-devkitc-1`

However any other `ESP32` board with these specs will work too:
  - Dual-core chip
  - Two usable SPI buses
  - 1MB or more `ROM` + room for SPIFFS

For the componenets:
  - 2x `nRF24L01+PA+LNA` modules
  - 2x `100uF` electrolytic capacitors of any voltage
  - Optionally, `SSD1306` OLED display (preferably `128x64`)
  - Prototype/Bread board, and some wiring

## Assembling

- Solder the capacitors across the `VCC` and `GND` pins of each `nRF24` module
- Wire the display/radio modules to your `ESP32` board according to the pinout
and your pin configuration in `include/preferences.h`

## Building

1. Install VSCode and PlatformIO
2. Edit preferences in `include/preferences.h`
3. If using a different board, port it into `platformio.ini`
4. Upload the code, and the SPIFFS filesystem image via platform tasks
